  You weave together threads of light to create a multicolored shimmering crystal sword of solidified light in your hand. This magic sword lasts until the spell ends. It counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient, and emits dim light in a 5ft radius. It has the finesse, light, and thrown properties (range 20/60). On hit, roll a d8 to determine which ray of color affects it:

  In addition, when you use the sword to attack a target that is in bright light, you make the attack roll with advantage.
  If you drop the weapon or throw it, it dissipates at the end of the turn. Thereafter, while the spell persists, you can use a bonus action to cause the sword to reappear in your hand.
   When you cast this spell using a 3rd- or 4th-level spell slot, the damage caused in the effects table increases by 1d6. When you cast it using a 5th- or 6th-level spell slot, the damage increases by 2d6. When you cast it using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6.
