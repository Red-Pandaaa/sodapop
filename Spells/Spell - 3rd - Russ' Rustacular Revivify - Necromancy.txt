Russ' Russtacular Revivify | 3rd-level necromancy
 Casting Time: 1 minute
 Range: Touch
 Components: V, S, M (Ambers worth 350 gp, which the spell consumes)
 Duration: Instantaneous
    You touch a creature that has died within the last hour. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with 1 hit point, and may spend up to half of their hit dice to heal, as if they took a long rest. This spell can't return to life a creature that has died of old age, or of a magical effect that caused the target to die instantly, nor can it restore any missing body parts.
    Coming back from the dead is taxing on the mind and body. The target takes a -1 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. This effect disappears after a long rest.
