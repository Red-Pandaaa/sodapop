At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Shadow Sorcerer Quirks table to create a quirk for your character.

| 1 | You are always icy cold to the touch.                                                         |
| 2 | When you are asleep, you don't appear to breathe (though you must still breathe to survive).  |
| 3 | You barely bleed, even when badly injured.                                                    |
| 4 | Your heart beats once per minute. This event sometimes surprises you.                         |
| 5 | You have trouble remembering that living creatures and corpses should be treated differently. |
| 6 | You blinked. Once. Last week.                                                                 |

### Shadow Sorcerer
Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Shadow Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an illusion or necromancy spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.
**Shadow Spells:**
|Sorcerer<br>Level| Spells                   |
|:---:|:------------------------------------:|
| 1st | Hex, Inflict Wounds                  |
| 3rd | Darkness, Gentle Repose              |
| 5th | Animate Dead, Bestow Curse           |
| 7th | Blight, Death Ward                   |
| 9th | Danse Macabre, Negative Energy Flood |

### Eyes of the Dark
From 1st level, you have darkvision with a range of 120 feet.
Additionally, as a bonus action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet, for 1 minute.

### Strength of the Grave
Starting at 1st level, your existence in a twilight state between life and death makes you difficult to defeat. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a Charisma saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken). On a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point. You can't use this feature if you are reduced to 0 hit points by radiant damage or by a critical hit.

After the saving throw succeeds, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 4 sorcery points to use it again.

### Shadow of Ill Omen
At 6th level, you gain the ability to call forth a howling creature of darkness to harass your foes. As a bonus action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to summon a shadow of ill omen to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The shadow uses the statistics of a brown bear, dire wolf, giant spider, or giant toad, with the following changes:
- The shadow is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a monstrosity, not a beast.
- It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level.
- It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The shadow takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
- At the start of its turn, the shadow automatically knows its target's location. If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the shadow.
The shadow appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the shadow. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its target. The shadow can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target. Additionally, while the shadow is within 5 feet of the target, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The shadow disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.

### Shadow Walk
At 14th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action, you can teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness.

### Umbral Form
Starting at 18th level, you can spend 6 sorcery points as a bonus action to transform yourself into a shadowy form. In this form, you have resistance to all damage except force and radiant damage, and you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 5 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.

You remain in this form for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you die, or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.
