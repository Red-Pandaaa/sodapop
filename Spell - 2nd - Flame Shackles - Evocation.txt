Flame Shackles | 2nd-level evocation
  Casting Time: 1 action
  Range: 60 feet
  Components: V, S, M (a pinch of sulfur and a scrap of blackened chain)
  Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
    You conjure searing chains of molten fire that coil around a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained by the chains. While restrained, the creature takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The shackles emit heat in a 5-foot radius, causing flammable objects in the area to ignite.
    A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If the creature escapes, the chains collapse into ash.
     When cast using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 per slot level.
