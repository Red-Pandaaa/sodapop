**Inept (Common).** You can use this hammer as a spellcasting focus.

**Competent (Uncommon).** The Competent hammer has the Inept property. In addition, when you hit with a melee attack using this magic hammer and reduce the target to half of their maximum hit points or below, you gain 3 temporary hit points. This can only trigger once per enemy.

**Amplified (Rare).** The Amplified hammer has the Inept property, and improves on the Competent property. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon. On reduction to half or less health, you gain an extra 2d6 temporary hit points.

As an action, you can unleash a gigantic diamond from the hammer 20-foot wide, 20-foot tall. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this action is used, it canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.
