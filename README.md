# **SodaPop's Dungeons and Dragons Homebrew Wiki**
Wiki for Dungeons and Dragons homebrew that I have created  
As always, check in with your DM first before using anything here

#### Notes:
##### Indebted Servant:
- This is a class I made for a specific character. The idea of this class is that this sidekick entered into a semi-pact with a player character, referred to as a "Master".
- If you use this class, I recommend creating a subclass _specifically tailored_ for the player character that the sidekick would be indebted to. That's the idea that I build the Gamil master for.  
##### Cantrips:
- I use the "Cantrips are 0th level spells" ideology when I name files. Any spells named "0th" are cantrips.  
##### Other:
- I use word wrap when I type out my everything. I suggest you also do, otherwise it will look odd.
- I use Visual Studio Code for _all_ of my D&D stuff, including character sheets. If something looks awfully plaintext, thats because it is.
- If you spy any line that starts with a "#", that is meant to be a comment, not part of the spell.
