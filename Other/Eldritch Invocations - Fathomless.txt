Spear of the Deep

Prerequisite: The Fathomless patron, Pact of the Blade feature

You can create a trident of solidified water using your Pact of the Blade feature. The trident's prongs each have their own sub-prong. The weapon's throw range is doubled, and it returns to the wielder when thrown. When you hit a creature with it, you can expend a spell slot to deal an additional 2d8 cold damage to the target per spell level.

Children of the underseas

Prerequisite: The Fathomless patron, Pact of the Chain feature

When you cast find familiar, and the familiar is a octopus, fish, or sea horse, it gains a flying speed of 40 feet, and can breathe outside of water. If it already has a flying speed, it is increased by 20ft. 
Additionally, as a bonus action, you can command the familiar to make a ranged weapon attack against a single target, that uses your spell attack modifier to hit, has a range of 30 feet, and deals 1d4 + your proficiency bonus cold damage.
If you already have the ability to command your familiar to make an attack, you may command it to attack twice, instead of once.
